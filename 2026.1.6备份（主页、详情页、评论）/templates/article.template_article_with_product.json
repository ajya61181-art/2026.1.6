Stress lowers serotonin, making your mood fragile and your brain desperate for the comfort of high-calorie food🍔. Carb-heavy meals spike your blood sugar and then drop it sharply, amplifying hunger and cravings, trapping you in a “control–indulge–regret” cycle🫣. The way out is to steady both mood and blood sugar⚖️.\n\n➡️ 5-HTP boosts serotonin so you feel calmer, fuller, and less likely to binge when stress or emotions hit🧘🏻‍♀️. White Kidney Bean extract blocks the enzyme that breaks down starch into sugar😊, slowing carb absorption, keeping blood sugar stable, and reducing those intense cravings for sweets and carbs😋. Once your mood and blood sugar are balanced, you naturally eat less, find your rhythm again, and turn weight loss from constant defeat into a victory you can stick with👍👍👍.","color_content":"#3c3c3c","fontsize_content":12,"margin_bottom":40}},"d26099c4-9298-4d24-be44-81f36c6a3bac":{"type":"product_block","disabled":true,"settings":{"heading":"Editor’s Picks","position":"content","column":"3","product_block_collection":"collection-home-1-1","product_block_layout":"slider","product_block_limit":5,"product_block_dots":true,"product_block_arrows":true}}},"block_order":["bced6fd1-310d-4026-8786-1f886c51eec2","96861bf3-10df-4b31-82bd-61aee2e9bc30","441f2329-1d0c-4d63-bcff-c7281f41bf54","71176645-a609-4ff4-90ca-dc2dedabac94","f1a4c4f6-e343-45a5-93ed-33109f5942ea","c04b7f25-8b25-4edb-a6fc-ed43934d98b4","9d7a0194-0d26-408a-8c12-bd9c7e2feb29","73becaeb-c487-4f3b-93aa-39f4bef40c07","df6f199c-e8b4-46e7-8d3f-12e6302e295c","d26099c4-9298-4d24-be44-81f36c6a3bac"],"settings":{"container":"1170","padding_full_width":0,"show_breadcrumb":false,"breadcrumb_alignment":"center","breadcrumb_bg":"","breadcrumb_gradient":"","breadcrumb_bg_mb":"#f6f6f6","breadcrumb_gradient_mb":"","show_page_title":true,"page_title_alignment":"left","show_collapse":false,"enable_sticky":false,"sidebar_layout":"layout_1","sidebar_collapse_default":"expand","sidebar_position":"left","sidebar_heading_font":"font_1","sidebar_heading_font_size":14,"sidebar_heading_font_weight":"700","sidebar_heading_text_transform":"uppercase","show_main_img":false,"show_author":true,"show_date":true,"show_tags":true,"show_share":true,"show_next_prev":true,"background_color":"","title_font":"font_2","title_font_size":18,"title_mobile_font_size":18,"title_font_weight":"600","title_text_transform":"capitalize","title_color":"#232323","text_font_size":12,"text_font_weight":"400","text_text_transform":"none","text_color":"#3c3c3c","info_font_size":12,"info_font_weight":"400","info_text_transform":"capitalize","info_font_style":"normal","info_color":"#999999","mg_top_desktop":0,"mg_top_tablet":0,"mg_top_mobile":0,"mg_bottom_desktop":0,"mg_bottom_tablet":0,"mg_bottom_mobile":0}}},"order":["main"]}
